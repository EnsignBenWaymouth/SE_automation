If you are going to modify/build any programs it's best if you pull the code locally to your PC.

Either use git (best for version control and reverting to previous versions), or download the zip directly at:
https://github.com/EnsignBenWaymouth/SE_automation.git

Alternatively you can just modify/run the programs from this directory
