Spy for Solid Edge is an open source .NET application written in C# that connects to a running instance of Solid Edge and exposes the underlying runtime COM API visually.

Solid Edge has a very large object model making it difficult to visualize and learn. The application greatly simplifies the process of learning the object model for beginners while also being useful to experts.

## Background
The original application (formerly Solid Edge Spy) was initially written and released in 2005 by Jason Newell on his personal website. The application was released at version 1.0 and has not been updated since. 9 years later (2014), it has been updated and made open source.
